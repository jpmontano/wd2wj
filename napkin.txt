Some unorganized thoughts jotted down on a napkin...

(1) Rule description
Non-inflecting, and always the same for both Wdaawaa and Wjibwe when coming from Wdaawaa to Wjibwe:
"go"->"go", "na"->"na", "naa"->"naa", "-sh"->"-sh", "wedi"->"wedi", "mii"->"mii", "aa"->"aa", "haaw"->"haaw", "bjiinag"->"bjiinag", "zhebaa"->"zhebaa"


(2) Rule description
Non-inflecting, and always different for Wdaawaa and Wjibwe when coming from Wdaawaa to Wjibwe:
"maampii"->"wmaandi", "zhonda"->"maawndi", "gondag"->"gowe", "nondan"->"nowe", "oodi"->"wdi", "washta oodi"->"was-wdi", "aanii"->"boozhoo"


(3) Rule description:
For (a) all 1p VAI (we exclusive) and 21p VAI (we inclusive); and (b) all 1p VAIO (we exclusive) and 21p VAIO (we inclusive)
wdaawaa   (we exclusive) n...mi OR (we inclusive) g...mi
=> wjibwe (we exclusive) n...min OR (we inclusive) g...min, respectively.

Regex:
echo "gga-wiisnimi" | sed -r "s/((^|[^a-zA-Z'-])(n|g|gg)[^ ]+mi)([^a-zA-Z'-]|$)/\1n/g"

Result:
# "We(incl.) shall eat."
wdaawaa: gga-wiisnimi
wjibwe:  gga-wiisnimin

Comments:
Seems we'd need to know the verb's actor (i.e., 1p (we exclusive) or 21p (we exclusive)). The 3s VAI "gtimi" ("He/She is lazy.") would otherwise trigger falsely.


(4) Rule description
wdaawaa initial-silent-w
=> not silent in wjibwe

Regex:
#

Result:
# "car" (noun animate)
wdaawaa: daabaan
wjibwe:  wdaabaan

# "Cree person" (noun animate)
wdaawaa: mashkiigoo
wjibwe:  wmashkiigoo

# "He/She is choosing s.t." (VTI)
wdaawaa: naabndaan
wjibwe:  wnaabndaan

# "cup" (noun inanimate)
wdaawaa: naagan
wjibwe:  wnaagan


(5) Rule description
wdaawaa changed conjunct plural ending -jig
=> wjibwe changed conjunct plural ending -waad

Regex:
#

Result:
# "The ones who wanna walk"
wdaawaa: waa-bmosejig
wjibwe:  waa-bmosewaad


(6) Rule description
wdaawaa past tense changed conjunct gaa-
=> wjibwe past tense changed conjunct gaa-gii-

Regex:
#

Result:
# "The one who ate"
wdaawaa: gaa-wiisnid
wjibwe:  gaa-gii-wiisnid


(7) Rule description
wdaawaa present tense changed conjunct e-
=> wjibwe past tense changed conjunct gaa-
For 'beings' (animate and inanimate), this rule is mandatory. For 'place' (i.e., wnji-) and 'manner' (i.e., zhi-), this rule is optional.

Regex:
#

Result:
# "The one who is eating"
# MANDATORY CONVERSION
wdaawaa: e-wiisnid
wjibwe:  gaa-wiisnid


# "The manner in which he/she is eating"
# OPTIONAL CONVERSION
wdaawaa: e-zhi-wiisnid
wjibwe:  e-zhi-wiisnid OR gaa-zhi-wiisnid


***************************************************************************
In the following example, the wdaawaa "enji" 'should' morph into "wenji".
But, it doesn't.
Instead, wjibwe uses the completely different preverb "dzhi-"
(instead of wdaawaa's "wnji-").
Additionally, "dzhi-" is irregular in that its _present tense_
changed conjunct form transforms the "d" morpheme into an "nd" morpheme:
"dzhi-": ('d', 'zh', 'i', '-') => ('e', 'nd', 'zh', 'i', '-')
The _past_ tense changed conjunt of "dzhi-", however, behaves regularly:
"dzhi-": ('d', 'zh', 'i', '-') => ('g', 'aa', '-', 'd', 'zh', 'i', '-')
[Note: wdaawaa exhibits this behavior, as well; but, for a different token.
       See wdaawaa's "daad (vai)", for example.]
***************************************************************************
# "The place which he/she is eating"
# OPTIONAL CONVERSION
wdaawaa: enji-wiisnid (silent initial 'w')
wjibwe:  endzhi-wiisnid OR gaa-dzhi-wiisnid


(8) Rule description
wdaawaa singular dubitative ending -dig
=> wjibwe singular dubitative ending -dog

Regex:
#

Result:
# yaa (3s VAI) "H/S is [in a certain place]."
wdaawaa: yaadig
wjibwe:  yaadog


(9) Rule description
wdaawaa singular preterit ending -ba
=> wjibwe singular preterit ending -ban

Regex:
#

Result:
# yaa (3s VAI) "H/S is [in a certain place]."
wdaawaa: yaaba
wjibwe:  yaaban

Some unorganized thoughts jotted down on a napkin...


(1) Rule description:
For (a) all 1p VAI (we exclusive) and 21p VAI (we inclusive); and (b) all 1p VAIO (we exclusive) and 21p VAIO (we inclusive)
wdaawaa   (we exclusive) n...mi OR (we inclusive) g...mi
=> wjibwe (we exclusive) n...min OR (we inclusive) g...min, respectively.

Regex:
echo "gga-wiisnimi" | sed -r "s/((^|[^a-zA-Z'-])(n|g|gg)[^ ]+mi)([^a-zA-Z'-]|$)/\1n/g"

Result:
# "We(incl.) shall eat."
wdaawaa: gga-wiisnimi
wjibwe:  gga-wiisnimin

Comments:
Seems we'd need to know the verb's actor (i.e., 1p (we exclusive) or 21p (we exclusive)). The 3s VAI "gtimi" ("He/She is lazy.") would otherwise trigger falsely.
